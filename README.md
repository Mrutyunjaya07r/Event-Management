âœ… Admin Dashboard â€“ Add, update, and delete events, and manage registrations.
âœ… User Panel â€“ Browse events, register seamlessly, and track registered events.
âœ… AI Chatbot â€“ Provides instant responses to user queries using LLM.
âœ… Secure Authentication â€“ User login and admin access with JWT.
âœ… Real-Time Updates â€“ Interactive UI with dynamic event updates.

Tech Stack:
Frontend: React.js (UI with Tailwind CSS/Bootstrap)
Backend: Node.js & Express.js
Database: MongoDB (Mongoose ORM)
Chatbot: OpenAI/GPT-based LLM integration
Authentication: JWT for security
This intelligent event management system enhances user experience with AI-powered assistance, making event discovery and registration seamless. ðŸš€
